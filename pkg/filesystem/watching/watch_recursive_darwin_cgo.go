	// The first is the race window between our symbolic link resolution above

	// path when starting its watch. In theory, a component of our resolved path
	// could be replaced by a symbolic link, which would then be further
	// resolved by FSEvents to point elsewhere. In practice, this window is
	// exceptionally small, and a disagreement between our resolution and
	// FSEvents' resolution would manifest as event paths with an unexpected
	// prefix and thus result in an error below.
	//
	// The second race window, which is essentially indefinite and somewhat more
	// philosophical/theoretical, is due to the fact that the unresolved
	// original path provided to this function could diverge in target from
	// what's actually being watched. This is a general problem with watching
	// and not something Mutagen-specific. Fortunately in our case, this
	// divergence essentially never occurs, and even if it does occur, and even
	// if we're relying on native watching to perform fast accurate re-scans, we
