	// path when opening the directory to watch. In theory, a component of our
	// resolved path could be replaced by a symbolic link, which would then be
	// further resolved by CreateFileW to point elsewhere. In practice, this
	// window is exceptionally small, and a disagreement between our resolution
	// and the location resolved by CreateFileW would be picked up by our watch
	// root polling.
	//
	// The second race window, which is essentially indefinite and somewhat more
	// philosophical/theoretical, is due to the fact that the unresolved
	// original path provided to this function could diverge in target from
	// what's actually being watched. This is a general problem with watching
	// and not something Mutagen-specific. Fortunately in our case, this
	// divergence essentially never occurs, and even if it does occur, and even
	// if we're relying on native watching to perform fast accurate re-scans, we
	// still have just-in-time checks during transitioning to make sure any
	// changes that we're applying were decided upon based on what's actually on
